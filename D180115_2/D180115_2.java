Challenge:
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

class TwoSum {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        int[] answer = new int[2]; 
        for(int x = 0; x < nums.length; x++)
        {
            for(int y = x+1; y < nums.length; y++) {
                if(nums[x]+nums[y]==target)
                {
                    answer[0]=x; answer[1]=y; return answer;
                }
            }   
        }
        return answer;
    }
}
