There is an integer array
with every element appearing twice.

find those two elements.

line = input("\nEnter Array: ")
userInput = [int(x) for x in line.split()]

print("\nInput: ", userInput)
result = []

for element in userInput:
    if element not in result:
        result.append(element)

    if element in result:
        result.remove(element)
